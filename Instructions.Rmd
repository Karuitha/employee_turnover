# Can you help reduce employee turnover?

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```


## 📖 Background
In this data analysis project, we assume that we are employees in the human capital department of a large corporation, ABC Inc. The Board of ABC Inc. is worried about the relatively high employee turnover. Our team must look into ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company.

Our team needs to understand better the situation, which employees are more likely to leave, and why. Once it is clear what variables impact employee churn, we shall present our findings and our ideas to the board on how to attack the problem.

## 💾 The data
The department has assembled data on almost 10,000 employees. The team gathered the data using information from exit interviews, performance reviews, and other employee records. The data consists of the following variables. 

```{r}
library(tibble)

tribble(~ variable, ~ Description,
        
        "department", "The department the employee belongs.",
        
        "promoted", "1 if the employee was promoted in the previous 24 months, 0 otherwise.", 
        
        "review", "The composite score the employee received in their last evaluation.", 
        
        "projects", "How many projects the employee is involved.", 
        
        "salary", "For confidentiality reasons, salary comes in three tiers: low, medium, and high.", 
        
        "tenure", "How many years the employee has been at the company.", 
        
        "satisfaction", "a measure of employee satisfaction from surveys.", 
        
        "avg_hrs_month", "the average hours the employee worked in a month.", 
        
        "left", "'yes' if the employee ended up leaving, 'no' otherwise.") %>% 
  
  kbl(., booktabs = TRUE)
```

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- readr::read_csv('./data/employee_churn_data.csv')
head(df)
```
